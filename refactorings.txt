Refactorings:
Used extract Method to breakup classes. Resulted in 5 classes: fieldInfo(), constructorInfo(), methodInfo(), classInfo(), traverse(), and inspect().
Rename fields also used to change the name of some fields.

Version Control:

git log --oneline
24f594f forgot classpath
ddac40d working test cases, output slightly changed
b6cb7f8 looks good, refactored recursive method using extract Method, and gave functions a return value to be used for testing.
54520c7 looks good, refactored using extractMethod for 4 separate methods
dcc27a7 seems to be good except recursion
1118c10 modifiers and fields seem to work, no arrays yet
505cdcf class information seems to be working
d815a64 initial, added driver
